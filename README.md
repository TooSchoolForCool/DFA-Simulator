# DFA Simulator

> This is a simple DFA simulator.
> ***
> Wirte down your DFA in a .dfa file, and load it into the program. Then the program will generate the DFA based on the description in the .dfa file. 
> ***
> After loading your DFA configuration, this program can tell you whether a expression(or a string) could be accepted by this DFA. What's more, this program can generate all accepted expressions automatically, once you determined the maximum length of the expression.
